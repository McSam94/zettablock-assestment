## Development Stack

The stack I'm using is following:

- üçé Framework => Nextjs (created using create-next-app cli)
- ‚ú® Styling => Scss
- üöÄ State Management => Redux Saga (Generator)
- üí£ Typing - Typescript
- ‚úèÔ∏è API - RESTful

---

## Why these stack?

- **NextJS**: Nextjs has been my favorite framework lately because nextjs provide alot of good feature such as directory structure routing, server side rendering and build-in CSS Support

- **Scss**: I've been using tailwind CSS a lot lately but since it's not allow, I'll be using the traditional scss way.

- **Redux Saga**: Looking at the requirement, I thought the code would be more readable with redux structure and easy to manage complex state. Not to mention easier to debug with time travel debugging.

- **Typescript**: Typescript is for safe type checking purpose and make the system more solid.

- **RESTful**: I notice that the company is using graphql but I'm not familiar with it and not confident to finish it within 2 days. So i decide to use Axios.
